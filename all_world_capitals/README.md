designed for video games, so the GDPs are mostly accurate, even Venezuela updated to drop it down the list (unrealistic)

some GDPs may suffer from being an old GDP (as official world bank GDPs don't always exist post revolution etc) ... Taiwan is corrected though so at least unlike the world bank i don't discriminate!
