this project is really just a collection of data, how to handle it, intended mainly for video game usage not science

really i'm just dealing with problems like:

  -what are the most important cities to put on the map (for a geopolitical game), list of capitals/nations rough gdp etc
  -how to i figure out where the various territories are
  -what are the most important stars if making a space game
  



merging geodata from worlbank:

https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?view=chart # Population


opendatasoft (world cities popultion)

joining them up for video game data purposes (useful data for making a geo-strategy game)


useful for geographic role playing games, and game dev but not perfect data, some countries wouldn't have had recent gdp data like Venezuela
