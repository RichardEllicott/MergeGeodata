found a political map from wikipedia that is correctly equirectangular

BlankMap-Equirectangular.svg 


running a python xml script through it, it's possible to set each country to a different colour

this can be used in a video game to assign a unique key to each country, based on color, and allow a mechanism for figuring which territory a unit is in


other things can also be achieved like drawing the outlines, to make an outline overlay
